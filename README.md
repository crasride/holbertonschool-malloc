<h1 align="center">C - malloc</h1>

### Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

* [[EYNTK] Writing your own dynamic allocation library](./EYNTK/README.md)

## Resources
**Read or watch:**

* [Hack the Virtual Memory: malloc, the heap & the program break](https://blog.holbertonschool.com/hack-the-virtual-memory-malloc-the-heap-the-program-break/)
* [Everything you need to know to write your own malloc](./Automatic_allocation.md)

**man or help:**

* `sbrk`
* `brk`
* `malloc`

**Learning Objectives**

At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
* What is a program break
* How to play with a program break in order to allocate memory dynamically
* How the glibc `malloc` and `free` functions work
* What is ASLR
* What is memory alignment
* What is a memory page
* How to encapsulate the memory management in order to hide it from the user

### Requirements
### General

* Allowed editors: `vi, vim, emacs`
* All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
* Your C programs and functions will be compiled with `gcc 4.8.4` using the flags `-Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic`
* All your files should end with a new line
* A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
* Your code should use the `Betty` style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/hs-hq/Betty/blob/main/betty-doc.pl)
* You are not allowed to have more than 5 functions per file
* The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called malloc.h
* Donâ€™t forget to push your header files
* All your header files should be include guarded
* You are allowed to use `global` variables
* You are allowed to use `static` variables

### Betty Compliance

* All the C source files in your directory and subdirectories must [Betty-compliant](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/abbd1E1RWALmHC6flq9S5w)

### Allowed Functions and System Calls

* Unless specified otherwise, you are allowed to use the C standard library
* Of course, youâ€™re not allowed to use the `malloc` family from the C libraryâ€¦

### Tests

* It is strongly advised to test your functions against real programs, like a shell, or your old projects for example.
* To do so, you can name your functions `malloc`, `free`, `realloc` and `calloc` (just like theyâ€™re name in the glibc), and compile them into a shared library that you would load when executing a program using {LD_LIBRARY_PATH} and `LD_PRELOAD`
* [Hereâ€™s a tutorial on how to do it](https://www.cprogramming.com/tutorial/shared-libraries-linux-gcc.html)

## More Info

### Important
It is not required that your _malloc, free, calloc and realloc behave exactly like the glibc malloc, free, calloc and realloc:

* You are free to use any data structure that suits you as long as their purpose is well defined
* You are free to handle the heap as it suits you, as long as the returned pointers (for the functions that return a pointer) are aligned as required and that enough space is available
* You are free to extend the program break as it suits you, as long as it is extended by a multiple of the virtual memory page size, and as long as it is reduced when needed
* You decide of your implementation. During the correction, we will mainly focus on the strength and reliability of your functions, so make sure to handle big allocations :)

# Tasks

## [0. Naive malloc]()

Read carefully the [concept page for this project](https://intranet.hbtn.io/concepts/891)

Build the naive malloc that is presented in the concept page.

* Prototype: `void *naive_malloc(size_t size);`
* Where size is the size needed to be allocated for the user
* Your function must return a pointer to the allocated memory that is suitably aligned for any kind of variable
* You naive malloc should be able to:
	* Allocate enough memory to store
		* A size_t as the chunk header
		*	The size requested as parameter
	* Allocate memory pages only

### Repo:

* GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-malloc`
* File: `naive_malloc.c`, `malloc.h`


## [1. malloc]()

Write you own `malloc` function that allocates space in the heap

* Prototype: `void *_malloc(size_t size);`
* Where `size` is the size needed to be allocated for the user
* Your function must return a pointer to the allocated memory that is suitably aligned for any kind of variable

### Repo:

* GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-malloc`
* File: `malloc.c`, `malloc.h`

## [2. free]()

Write you own free function that frees a memory space

* Prototype: `void _free(void *ptr);`
* Where `ptr` is a pointer to the memory space to be freed

### Repo:

* GitHub repository: `holbertonschool-malloc`
* File: `free.c`, `malloc.c`, `malloc.h`
